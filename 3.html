    <h2>JavaScript</h2>
    <p>JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),
    often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level,
    interpreted programming language that conforms to
    the ECMAScript specification.
    JavaScript has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing,
    prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.</p>

    <p>Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies
     of the World Wide Web. JavaScript enables interactive web
     pages and is an essential part of web applications.
     The vast majority of websites use it, and major web browsers
     have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.</p>

     <p style = "margin-top:45px;">As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven,
     functional, and imperative (including object-oriented and
     prototype-based) programming styles. It has APIs for working
     with text, arrays, dates, regular expressions, and the DOM,
     but the language itself does not include any I/O, such as
     networking, storage, or graphics facilities. It relies upon
     the host environment in which it is embedded to provide
     these features.</p>
